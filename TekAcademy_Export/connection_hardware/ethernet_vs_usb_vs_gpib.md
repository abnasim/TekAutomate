## Why Ethernet is King

When automating test equipment, your connection method determines reliability, speed, and ease of use. Here's why Ethernet should be your first choice:

Ethernet provides galvanic isolation between your PC and the instrument. This means electrical noise, ground loops, and potential differences won't corrupt your measurements. USB and GPIB lack this protection.

> 💡 **No Drivers Required**
> 
> Ethernet connections use standard TCP/IP protocols. No vendor-specific drivers needed—just an IP address and you're connected. USB requires driver installation and can conflict with other devices.
