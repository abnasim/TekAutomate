Create a Blockly XML workflow for the following automation:

1. Connect to a scope at IP 192.168.1.10 using PyVISA
2. Connect to a PSU at IP 192.168.1.15 using PyVISA
3. Configure the scope:
   - Set CH1 scale to 1.0
   - Set CH2 scale to 0.5
   - Set horizontal scale to 1E-6
   - Set acquisition mode to SAMPLE
4. Create a loop that runs 5 times:
   - Set PSU voltage to 1.0 + (loop_index * 0.5)
   - Wait 0.5 seconds
   - Switch to scope device
   - Start acquisition on scope
   - Wait for OPC with 5 second timeout
   - Save waveform from CH1 with filename "capture_{loop_index}.wfm"
5. Disconnect all devices

Use proper device context switching for multi-instrument control.
