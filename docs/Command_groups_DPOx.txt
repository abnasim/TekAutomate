Command syntax
You can control the operations and functions of the instrument through the use of commands and queries. The following related topics describe the syntax
of these commands and queries, as well as the conventions that the instrument uses to process them. See the Command Groups topic in the table of contents for a listing of the commands by command group, or use the index to locate a specific command.
Backus-Naur Form notation
This guide describes the commands and queries using Backus-Naur Form (BNF) notation. Refer to the following table for the symbols that are used.
Table 2-1: Symbols for Backus-Naur Form
Symbol	Meaning
< >	Defined element
::=	Is defined as
|	Exclusive OR
{ }	Group; one element is required
[ ]	Optional; can be omitted
. . .	Previous element(s) may be repeated
( )	Comment
 
Command and query structure
Commands consist of set commands and query commands (usually called commands and queries). Commands modify instrument settings or tell the instrument to perform a specific action. Queries cause the instrument to return data and status information.
Most commands have both a set form and a query form. The query form of the command differs from the set form by its question mark on the end. For example, the set command ACQuire:MODe has a query form ACQuire:MODe?. Not all commands have both a set and a query form. Some commands have set only and some have query only.

Messages  A command message is a command or query name followed by any information the instrument must have in order to execute the command or query. Command messages can contain five element types, defined in the following table.
 
Command syntax
 

Table 2-2: Command message elements
Symbol	Meaning

<Header>	This is the basic command name. If the header ends with a question mark, the command is a query. The header may begin with a colon (:) character. If the command is concatenated with other commands, the beginning colon is required. Never use the beginning colon with command headers beginning with an asterisk (*).
 
<Mnemonic>	This is a header subfunction. Some command headers have only one mnemonic. If a command header has multiple mnemonics, a colon (:) character always separates them from each other.
<Argument>	This is a quantity, quality, restriction, or limit associated with the header. Some commands have no arguments while others have multiple arguments. A <space> separates arguments from the header. A <comma> separates arguments from each other.
 
<Comma>	A single comma is used between arguments of multiple-argument commands. Optionally, there may be white space characters before and after the comma.
<Space>	A white space character is used between a command header and the related argument. Optionally, a white space may consist of multiple white space characters.
 
Commands	Commands cause the instrument to perform a specific function or change one of the settings. Commands have the structure:
[:]<Header>[<Space><Argument>[<Comma> <Argument>]...]
A command header consists of one or more mnemonics arranged in a hierarchical or tree structure. The first mnemonic is the base or root of the tree and each subsequent mnemonic is a level or branch off the previous one. Commands at
a higher level in the tree can affect those at a lower level. The leading colon (:) always returns you to the base of the command tree.

Queries	Queries cause the instrument to return status or setting information. Queries have the structure:
 	[:]<Header>?

 	[:]<Header>?[<Space><Argument> [<Comma><Argument>]...]
You can specify a query command at any level in the command tree unless otherwise noted. These branch queries return information about all the mnemonics below the specified branch or level. For example, HIStogram:STATistics:STDdev? returns the standard deviation of the histogram, HIStogram:STATistics? returns all the histogram statistics, and HIStogram? returns all the histogram parameters.

Headers	You can use the HEADer command to control whether the instrument returns headers as part of the query response. If header is on, the query returns command
 
Command syntax
 


headers and then formats itself as a valid set command. If header is off, the response includes only the values. This can make it easier to parse and extract information from the response. The table shows the difference in responses.
Table 2-3: Comparison of header off and header on responses

Query	Header off	Header on
TIME?	”14:30:00”	:TIME”14:30:00”
ACQuire:NUMAVg?	100	:ACQUIRE:NUMAVG 100

Clearing the instrument
You can use the selected Device Clear (DCL) GPIB function to clear the Output Queue and reset the instrument to accept a new command or query. Refer to your GPIB library documentation for details about the Device Clear operation.

 
Command entry
 

The following rules apply when entering commands:
 	You can enter commands in upper or lower case.
 	You can precede any command with white space characters. White space characters include any combination of the ASCII control characters 00 through 09 and 0B through 20 hexadecimal (0 through 9 and 11 through 32 decimal).
 	The instrument ignores commands consisting of any combination of white space characters and line feeds.
 

Abbreviating	You can abbreviate many instrument commands. Commands in this document show the abbreviations in capitals. For example, you can enter the command
ACQuire:NUMAvg simply as ACQ:NUMA or acq:numa. Abbreviation rules can change over time as new instrument models are introduced. Thus, for the most robust code, use the full spelling.
If you use the HEADer command to have command headers included as part of query responses, you can further control whether the returned headers are abbreviated or are full-length with the VERBose command.
 
Command syntax
 

Concatenating	You can concatenate any combination of set commands and queries using a semicolon (;). The instrument executes concatenated commands in the order received. When concatenating, you must follow these rules:
1.	Separate completely different headers by a semicolon and by the beginning colon on all commands except the first one. For example, the commands TRIGger:MODe NORMal and ACQuire:NUMAVg 10, can be concatenated into the following single command:
TRIGger:MODe NORMal;:ACQuire:NUMAVg 10
2.	If concatenated commands have headers that differ by only the last mnemonic, you can abbreviate the second command and eliminate the beginning colon. For example, you can concatenate the commands ACQuire:MODe ENVelope and ACQuire:NUMAVg 10 into a single command:
ACQuire:MODe ENVelope; NUMAVg 10
The longer version works equally well:
ACQuire:MODe ENVelope;:ACQuire:NUMAVg 10
3.	Never precede a star (*) command with a colon:
ACQuire:MODe ENVelope;*OPC
Any commands that follow will be processed as if the star command was not there, so the commands ACQuire:MODe ENVelope;*OPC;NUMAVg 10 will set the acquisition mode to envelope and set the number of acquisitions for averaging to 10.
4.	When you concatenate queries, the responses to all the queries are concatenated into a single response message. For example, if the display imageview color is temperature and the display recordview color is spectral, the concatenated query DISplay:COLOr:PALETTE:IMAGEVIEW?; RECORDVIEW? will return the following.
If the header is on:
:DISPLAY:COLOR:PALETTE:IMAGEVIEW TEMPERATURE;
:DISPLAY:COLOR:PALETTE:RECORDVIEW SPECTRAL
If the header is off:
TEMPERATURE;SPECTRAL
5.	Set commands and queries can be concatenated in the same message. For example,
ACQuire:MODe SAMple;NUMAVg?;STATE?
is a valid message that sets the acquisition mode to sample. The message then queries the number of acquisitions for averaging and the acquisition state.
Concatenated commands and queries are executed in the order received.
 
Command syntax
 


Here are some invalid concatenations:
DISplay:PERSistance:RESET;ACQuire:NUMAVg 10 (no colon before ACQuire)
DISplay:GRAticule FULl;:FILTer SINX (extra colon before FILTer; use
DISplay:GRAticule FULl;FILTer SINX instead)
DISplay:PERSistance:RESET;:*OPC (colon before a star (*) command)
DISplay:COLOr:MATHCOLOr DEFAULT;COLOr:REFCOLOr INHERIT (levels
of the mnemonics are different; either remove the second use of COLor or place
:DISPlay: in front of COLOr:REFCOLOr INHERIT)

Terminating	This documentation uses <EOM> (End of message) to represent a message terminator.
Table 2-4: End of Message terminator
Symbol	Meaning
<EOM>	Message terminator
 
The end-of-message terminator must be the END message (EOI asserted concurrently with the last data byte). The last data byte may be an ASCII linefeed (LF) character.
This instrument does not support ASCII LF only message termination. The instrument always terminates outgoing messages with LF and EOI.
Constructed mnemonics
Some header mnemonics specify one of a range of mnemonics. For example, a channel mnemonic can be CH1, CH2, CH3, or CH4. You use these mnemonics in the command just as you do any other mnemonic. For example, there is a CH1:POSition command, and there is also a CH2:POSition command. In the command descriptions, this list of choices is abbreviated as CH<x>.

 
Cursor Position Mnemonics
 
When cursors are displayed, commands may specify which cursor of the pair to use.
Table 2-5: Cursor mnemonics
Symbol	Meaning

CURSOR<x>	A cursor selector; <x> is either 1 or 2. POSITION<x>	A cursor selector; <x> is either 1 or 2. HPOS<x>	A cursor selector; <x> is either 1 or 2.
 
 
 
Command syntax
 

Math specifier mnemonics	Commands can specify the mathematical waveform to use as a mnemonic in the header.
Table 2-6: Math specifier mnemonics
Symbol	Meaning
Math<x>	A math waveform specifier; <x> is 1 through 4.
 

 
Measurement specifier
mnemonics
 
Commands can specify which measurement to set or query as a mnemonic in the header. Up to eight automated measurements can be displayed.
Table 2-7: Measurement specifier mnemonics
Symbol	Meaning
MEAS<x>	A measurement specifier; <x> is 1 through 8.
 
 
Channel mnemonics	Commands specify the channel to use as a mnemonic in the header.
Table 2-8: Channel Mnemonics
Symbol	Meaning

CH<x>	A channel specifier; <x> is 1 through 4. SOURCE<1..2>	 A source specifier, the source can be 1 through 2.
 

 
Reference waveform
mnemonics
 
Commands can specify the reference waveform to use as a mnemonic in the header.
Table 2-9: Reference waveform mnemonics
Symbol	Meaning
REF<x>	A reference waveform specifier; <x> is 1 thru 4.
 
 
Argument types
Numeric	Many instrument commands require numeric arguments. The syntax shows the format that the instrument returns in response to a query. This is also the preferred
format when sending the command to the instrument, though any of the formats will be accepted. This documentation represents these arguments as follows:
 
Command syntax
 

Table 2-10: Numeric arguments
Symbol	Meaning
<NR1>	Signed integer value
<NR2>	Floating point value without an exponent
<NR3>	Floating point value with an exponent
 
Most numeric arguments will be automatically forced to a valid setting, either by rounding or truncating, when an invalid number is input unless otherwise noted in the command description.

Quoted String	Some commands accept or return data in the form of a quoted string, which is simply a group of ASCII characters enclosed by a single quote (') or double quote ("). The following is an example of a quoted string: "This is a quoted
string". This documentation represents these arguments as follows:
Table 2-11: Quoted string argument
Symbol	Meaning
<QString>	Quoted string of ASCII text
 
A quoted string can include any character defined in the 7-bit ASCII character set. Follow these rules when you use quoted strings:
1.	Use the same type of quote character to open and close the string. For example: "this is a valid string".
2.	You can mix quotation marks within a string if you follow the previous rule. For example, "this is an 'acceptable' string".
3.	You can include a quote character within a string by repeating the quote. For example: "here is a "" mark".
4.	Strings can have upper or lower case characters.
5.	If you use a GPIB network, you cannot terminate a quoted string with the END message before the closing delimiter.
6.	A carriage return or line feed embedded in a quoted string does not terminate the string, but is treated as just another character in the string.
7.	The maximum length of a quoted string returned from a query is 255 characters.
Here are some invalid strings:
 	"Invalid string argument' (quotes are not of the same type)
 	"test<EOI>" (termination character is embedded in the string)
Block	Several instrument commands use a block argument form (see the following table).
 
Command syntax
 

Table 2-12: Block argument
Symbol	Meaning
<NZDig>	A nonzero digit character in the range of 1–9
<Dig>	A digit character, in the range of 0–9

<DChar>	A character with the hexadecimal equivalent of 00 through FF (0 through 255 decimal)
 
<Block>	A block of data bytes defined as: <Block> ::=
{#<NZDig><Dig>[<Dig>...][<DChar>...]
|#0[<DChar>...]<terminator>}
 
<NZDig> specifies the number of <Dig> elements that follow. Taken together, the <NZDig> and <Dig> elements form a decimal integer that specifies how many <DChar> elements follow.
NOTE. The digit <NZDig> is in hexadecimal format. This deviates slightly from the IEEE 488.2 specification that it be in decimal format, as extra allowances must be made for data lengths that are greater than 999,999,999 <DChar> elements (for example 500M record lengths at 2 bytes per point).


 
Command groups
The programmable interface conforms to Tektronix standard codes and formats except where noted. The GPIB interface also conforms to IEEE Std 488.2-1987 except where noted.
Acquisition command group
Acquisition commands set up the modes and functions that control how the instrument acquires signals and processes them into waveforms. Using these commands for acquiring waveforms, you can do the following:
 	Start and stop acquisitions.
 	Control whether each waveform is simply acquired, averaged, or enveloped over successive acquisitions of that waveform.
 	Set the controls or conditions that start and stop acquisitions.
 	Determine the action the system takes upon completing an acquisition, such as saving all waveforms and taking a measurement.
 	Control acquisition of acquired channel waveforms.
 	Set acquisition parameters.

Command groups
 

 
Alias command group
 

Alias commands allow you to define new commands as a sequence of standard commands. You might find this useful when repeatedly using the same commands to perform certain tasks like setting up measurements.
Aliases are similar to macros but do not include the capability to substitute parameters into alias bodies. The alias mechanism obeys the following rules:
 	The alias name must consist of a valid IEEE 488.2 message unit, which may not appear in a message preceded by a colon, comma, or a command or query program header.
 	The alias name may not appear in a message followed by program date, a colon, comma, or question mark.
 	An alias name must be distinct from any keyword or keyword short form.
 	An alias name cannot be redefined without first being deleted using one of the alias deletion functions.
 	Alias names do not appear in response messages.
 	The Alias commands are defined in Tektronix Standard Codes and Formats. Deviations between that standard and what is specified here will be considered errors unless specifically noted in the command description in this document.

Calibration command group
The Calibration commands provide information about the current state of instrument calibration and allow you to initiate internal signal path calibration (SPC).
NOTE. When running SPC through the remote interface, calibration status cannot be obtained until after the SPC completes, which can take several minutes. Any remote command that performs an action on the oscilloscope is also disabled until the SPC is complete.

Table 2-17: Calibration commands
Command	Description
CALibrate?	Returns the internal and factory calibration status

*CAL?	Instructs the instrument to perform self-calibration and returns the calibration status when complete. Takes several minutes to run
 
CALibrate:CALProbe:CH<x>?	Performs a probe calibration for the selected channel and returns the calibration
status
CALibrate:INTERNal	Starts the internal signal path calibration. Takes several minutes to run

Command groups
 
Cursor command group
Use the commands in the Cursor Command Group to control the cursor display and readout. You can use these commands to control the setups for cursor 1 and cursor 2, such as waveform source, cursor position, and cursor color.
You can also use the commands to select one of the following cursor functions:
 	Off. Shuts off the display of all cursors.
 	Vertical bars. Displays vertical bar cursors, which provide traditional horizontal unit readouts for Cursor 1 (bar1), Cursor 2 (bar2), the delta between them, and 1/delta (results in frequency when the horizontal unit is time).
 	Horizontal bars. Displays horizontal bar cursors, which provide traditional vertical unit readouts for Cursor 1 (bar1), Cursor 2 (bar2), and the delta between them.
 	Waveform cursors. Consists of two cursors you can independently assign to a waveform. These cursors provide the same readouts that the vertical and horizontal bar cursors provide. Waveform cursors enable you to conveniently measure waveform amplitude and time. In XY or XYZ format, waveform cursors indicate the amplitude position of an XY pair (Ch1 vs Ch2 voltage, where Ch1 is the X axis and Ch2 is the Y axis) relative to the trigger.
 	Screen cursors. Consists of two pairs of independent horizontal and vertical cursors. You can use these cursors to indicate an arbitrary position within the waveform display area. Screen cursors, depending on the style selected, consist of the intersection of a vertical and horizontal line, an X, or a vertical line with an X. These cursors have no association with any waveform, except that they inherit the color of the waveform they are assigned to.

E-mail command group
Commands in the E-mail group allow you to send e-mail to one or more designated recipients whenever a selected event, such as a trigger, a mask test failure (Option MTM only), or a limit test failure occurs in the instrument.
Using this feature, you do not have to continually monitor the instrument for the event.
When an event occurs, the instrument will send an SMTP mail message to one or more designated recipients through the specified mail server. The message can include any of the following:
 	Screen image
 	Waveform data
 	Measurement data at the time of the event
NOTE. Your instrument must be connected to the Local Area Network (LAN) using Transfer C Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). The recipient must also have an SMTP mail server. To send e-mail for a mask test failure, you must have Mask Testing (Option MTM) installed.

Error Detector command group
NOTE. Not available on some models.
 

The error detector provides error detection on many serial standards. This section provides error detector theory and a list of commands in the error detector command group.

 
Error Detector theory of
operation
 
The Tektronix error detector option provides the following:
 	Automated receiver testing using AWG7000 Series
 	SATA Bit Error Detection: 1.5 Gb/s, 3.0 Gb/s, and 6.0 Gb/s Standards
 	SATA Frame Error Detection: 1.5 Gb/s, 3.0 Gb/s, and 6.0 Gb/s Standards
 	USB 3.0 Symbol Error Detection: 5 Gb/s Standard
 	PCIe Gen1 and Gen2 Bit Error Detection: 5 Gb/s Standard
 	Illegal Character and Disparity Error Detection: 1.25 Gb/s to 6.25 Gb/s
 	Tracking for Spread Spectrum Clocks with up to 5000 ppm (downspread) The following table lists the various types of error detection:
 
Table 2-23: Types of error detection

Error Type	(Units) Error Rate	(Units) Resolution	Effectiveness	Limitations
Character	Number of character errors per number of characters tested	Character	90% to 95%	Can miss errors if a character is changed to a legal character
Frame	Number of frame errors per number of frames tested	Frame	100%
(finds all errors)	Many bit errors can equal one frame error
Symbol	Number of symbol errors per number of symbols tested	Symbol	100%
(finds all errors)	Several bit errors can equal one symbol error
Bit	Number of bit errors per number of bits tested	Bit	100%
(finds all errors)	Pattern length limited by memory depth
For non-USB bit error testing, you must provide the signal test pattern length and sync pattern. Align characters must be provided for all test types. All of these parameter values depend on the actual signal test pattern. The signal test pattern length is generally known from the signal generator setup.
The align character is a 10-bit character with both RD+ and RD– disparity values and must actually be present in the signal test pattern to keep the receiver aligned to the 10-bit character boundaries.
The sync pattern is a unique 10-, 20-, 30-, or 40-bit sequence (one to four 10-bit characters) that must actually be present in the signal test pattern to align the
 
Command groups
 


signal so that bit-by-bit comparisons can be made. The sync pattern does not have to be “at the beginning” of the signal test pattern but it can be anywhere in the signal test pattern, as the fixed-length signal test pattern is sent repetitively by the signal generator.
To better understand the bit error detector, examine and use the setup files that contain the parameter settings in GPIB command format. Signal test patterns are supported with the following setup files:
 	Any8B10BCJTPatBitErrorSetup.txt
 	Any8B10BCJTPcharacterErrorSetup.txt
 	PCIeCJTPatBit ErrorSetup.txt
 	SataCJTPatBitErrorSetup.txt
 	SataCJTPatCharactErrorSetup.txt
 	SataFrameComplianceFrameErrorSetup.txt
 	SataHFTPbitErrorSetjup.txt
 	SataLBPbitErrorSetup.txt
 	SataLFTPbitErrorSetup.txt
 	SataMFTPbitErrorSetup.txt
 	UsbCP0_SKPbitErrorSetup.txt
 	UsbCP0_SKPcharacterErrorSetup.txt
 	UsbCP0_SKPsymbolErrorSetup.txt
 	PcieGen1ComplianceBitErrorSetup.txt
 	PcieGen2ComplianceBitErrorSetup.txt
The oscilloscope error detector has the ability to “learn” the pattern from the signal test pattern. This capability can be used when you suspect that your DUT might have unintentional design/logic errors that modify the signal test pattern before it reaches the oscilloscope. In this case, the oscilloscope can “learn” the Modified signal test pattern, so that testing can continue even in the presence of the design/logic error.
The USB bit error and USB symbol error detection follow the same concept as SATA frame error detection. In frame error detection, the received serial data is kept aligned to 10-bit boundaries, converted from 10-bit characters to 8-bit
characters, monitored for Start of Frame (SOF) and End of Frame (EOF) symbols, scrambled per the specification, to both compute the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and extract the transmitted CRC from the data. The align primitives can be detected and rejected if desired.

Command groups
 
File system command group
Use the commands in the File System Command Group to help you use the built-in hard disk drive. You can use the commands to do the following:
 	List the contents of the default directory
 	Create and delete directories
 	Create, copy, read, rename, or delete a file
When using these commands, keep the following points in mind:
 	File arguments are always enclosed within double quotes: “C:\MYDIR\TEK00001.SET”
 	File names follow the MS-DOS format: [DRIVE:][\PATH\]filename
 	Path separators can be either forward slashes (/) or back slashes (\)
NOTE. Using a back slash as a path separator can produce some unexpected results, depending on how your controller application treats escaped characters. Many applications recognize the sequence of a back slash followed by an alphabetic character as an escaped character, and, as such, interpret that
alphabetic character as a control character. For example, the sequence “\n” might be interpreted as a newline character; “\t” might be interpreted as a tab character. To ensure that this interpretation does not occur, you can use double back slashes. For example, “C:\\testfile.txt”.

Mask command group
 

Mask commands compare incoming waveforms to standard or user-defined telecommunications masks. Standard masks are available only with option MTM installed. Without option MTM, you must define your masks. When waveforms fall inside or outside the mask limits, the instrument can generate hard copy, save the waveform, emit a beep or SRQ, stop and wait for your input, send an E-mail message with specified data, log the time/date of the acquired waveform, or a combination of these actions.
A mask is a set of polygonal regions on the screen. Every vertical line of the screen intersects the polygon in zero, one, or two places, but never in more than two places. (A vertical line that intersects a vertical mask border is counted.) You have to break up more complicated polygons into two separate segments. Unlike limit testing, the inside of a mask is the region where waveform data would
not normally fall. A telecommunications standard requires up to eight of these segments. Pulse standards always have two segments. Standards with eye patterns usually have three masks, but some have four.
You use the commands in the Mask Command Group to do the following:
 	Specify the waveform source to test and the mask to use.
 	Specify whether to use, and the size of, mask margins, which allow you to shrink or expand an existing set of polygons by a specified percentage.
 	Specify whether to display a readout of hits and the mask on screen. You can also autofit the incoming waveforms to match the mask you choose.
 	Select industry-standard masks that support a variety of electrical and optical communication standards (available with an option).
 	Define and edit your own custom mask; create a new mask, or edit a standard mask (optional) to meet your needs.
 	Enable, disable, or reset the mask counts. Once you turn on mask counting, it remains on until you explicitly turn it off.
Options also provide communication trigger commands that you can use with the mask commands, such as TRIGger:A:TYPe Communication. Refer to the Trigger Command Group.

Math command group







Table 2-32: Math commands
 

Use the commands in the Math Command Group to create and define math waveforms. You can define and display up to four math waveforms simultaneously on four channel models and up to two on two channel models. Use the available math functions to define your math waveform.
The math waveform you create depends on sources listed in the math expression. If you change these sources, the math waveforms you previously defined will be affected.
Math expressions can be simple, containing no mathematical computation, such as CH1, which specifies that a waveform shows the signal source of channel 1. Math expressions can also be complex, consisting of 100 plus characters and comprising many sources, functions, and operands.
The acquisition of a live waveform can stop for several reasons: You can turn off the channel, stop the waveform (via Run/Stop from the Horiz/Acq menu), or stop the trigger (via Run/Stop from the Trig menu). When you turn off the channel, math continues and data is acquired but is not displayed. When you stop either the waveform or the trigger, the math calculation stops, and the last math calculation performed is displayed.
When a live waveform update or reference waveform is altered, math waveforms containing those waveforms as sources are also updated to reflect the changes.
Also, sources must exist but do not need to be displayed to be used in and to update math waveforms.

Measurement command group
Use the commands in the Measurement Command Group to control the automated measurement system.
Up to eight automated measurements can be displayed on the screen. In the commands, these measurement readouts are named MEAS<x>, where <x> can be 1 through 8.
In addition to the eight displayed measurements, the measurement commands let you specify an additional measurement, IMMed. The immediate measurement has no front panel equivalent. Immediate measurements are never displayed.
Because they are computed only when needed, immediate measurements slow the waveform update rate less than displayed measurements.
Whether you use displayed or immediate measurements, use the VALue query to obtain measurement results.
Measurement commands can set and query measurement parameters. You can assign parameters, such as waveform sources and reference levels, differently for each measurement.

Command groups
 
Status and Error command group
Use the commands in the Status and Error command Group to determine the status of the instrument and control events.
Several commands and queries used with the instrument are common to all devices on the GPIB bus. The IEEE Std 488.2-1987 defines these commands and queries. The common commands begin with an asterisk (*) character.
Table 2-38: Status and Error commands
Command	Description
*CLS	Clears status
*ESE	Sets or queries the bits in the Event Status Enable Register
*ESR?	Returns the contents of the Standard Event Status Register

Command groups
 
Trigger command group
Use the commands in the Trigger Command Group to control all aspects of triggering for the instrument.
There are two triggers: A and B. Where appropriate, the command set has parallel constructions for each trigger.
You can set the A or B triggers to edge mode. Edge triggering lets you display a waveform at or near the point where the signal passes through a voltage level of your choosing.
You can also set A or B triggers to pulse or logic modes. With pulse triggering, the instrument triggers whenever it detects a pulse of a certain width or height. Logic triggering lets you logically combine the signals on one or more channels. The instrument then triggers when it detects a certain combination of signal levels. Video triggering enables you to trigger on the most common Standard Definition, High Definition, and custom video standards. You can trigger on all fields, all lines, or individual video lines.
NOTE. Not available on some models.
 

If you have Option MTH or MTM (Mask Testing) installed, you also have access to a communication mode. When this mode is selected, several communication trigger commands are available that work with the mask commands. Refer to Mask Command Group.

Command groups
 
Waveform Transfer command group
Use the commands in the Waveform Transfer Command Group to transfer waveform data points to and from the instrument. Waveform data points are a collection of values that define a waveform. One data value usually represents one data point in the waveform record. When working with envelope waveforms, each data value is either the minimum or maximum of a min/max pair.
Before you transfer waveform data, you must specify the data format, record length, and waveform source.
Data formats. Acquired waveform data uses eight or more bits to represent each data point. The number of bits used depends on the acquisition mode specified when you acquired the data. Data acquired in SAMple or ENVelope mode uses eight bits per waveform data point. Data acquired in AVERage mode uses up to
14 bits per point.
The instrument can transfer waveform data in either ASCII or binary format. You specify the format with the DATa:ENCdg command. The instrument uses signed, 4 byte integers and floating point values; it does not support unsigned floating point values.
ASCII data is represented by signed integer or floating point values. An example ASCII waveform data string can look like this:
CURVE<space>-110,-109,-110,-110,-109,-107,
-109,-107,-106,-105,-103,-100,-97,-90,-84,-80
Use ASCII to obtain more readable and easier to format output than binary. However, ASCII can require more bytes to send the same values than it does with binary. This can reduce transmission speeds.
Binary data can be represented by signed integer or floating point values. The range of the values depends on the byte width specified. When the byte width is one, signed integer data ranges from -128 to 127, and positive integer values range from 0 to 255. When the byte width is two, the values range from -32768 to 32767. When a MATH (or REF that came from a MATH) is used, 32-bit floating point values are used that are four bytes in width.
 
Command groups
 


The defined binary formats specify the order in which the bytes are transferred. The following are the four binary formats:
 	RIBinary specifies signed integer data-point representation with the most significant byte transferred first.
 	SRIBinary is the same as RIBinary except that the byte order is swapped, meaning that the least significant byte is transferred first. This format is useful when transferring data to PCs.
 	RFBinary specifies floating point data-point representation with the most significant byte transferred first.
 	SRFBinary is the same as RFBinary except that the byte order is swapped, meaning that the least significant byte is transferred first. This format is useful when transferring data to PCs.
Waveform data and record lengths. You can transfer multiple points for each waveform record. You can transfer a portion of the waveform or you can transfer the entire record. You can use the DATa:STARt and DATa:STOP commands to specify the first and last data points of the waveform record.
When transferring data into the instrument, you must first specify the record length of the destination waveform record. You do this with the WFMInpre:NR_Pt command. Next, specify the first data point within the waveform record. For example, when you set DATa:STARt to 1, data points will be stored starting
with the first point in the record. The instrument will ignore the value set by DATa:STOP when reading in data. It will stop reading data when there is no more data to read or when it has reached the specified record length.
The CURVe command cannot be used to transfer FastFrame waveforms into the instrument.
When transferring data from the instrument, you must specify the first and last data points in the waveform record. Setting DATa:STARt to 1 and DATa:STOP to the record length will always return the entire waveform.
For CURVe? queries of FastFrame acquisitions, the data for each frame is concatenated together into one long stream. For example, if you acquire 5 frames of 1000 points each, a curve query (with DATA:START 1 and DATA:STOP 1000) will return 5 * 1000 or 5000 data points. There is no separator between each frame in the data.
If you set DATA:START and DATA:STOP to a subset of the record length then you get that section of data from each frame. For example, with 5 frames of 1000 points each and DATA:START 101 and DATA:STOP 150, you will get points 101-150 for the first frame followed by points 101-150 of the second frame, and similar things. In this case the total number of points returned will be 5 * 50 or 250 points.
Waveform data locations and memory allocation. The DATa:SOUrce command specifies the waveform source when transferring a waveform from the instrument.
 
Command groups
 


Waveforms sent to the instrument are always stored in one of the four reference memory locations. Use the DATa:DESTination command to specify a reference memory location.
Waveform preamble. Each waveform that you transfer has an associated waveform preamble that contains information such as the horizontal scale, the vertical scale, and other settings in effect when the waveform was created. Refer to the individual WFMInpre? and WFMOutpre? commands for more information.
Scaling waveform data. Once you transfer the waveform data to the controller, you can convert the data points into voltage values for analysis using information from the waveform preamble.
Transferring waveform data from the instrument.
You can transfer waveforms from the instrument to an external controller using the following sequence:
1.	Select the waveform source(s) using DATa:SOUrce.
2.	Specify the waveform data format using DATa:ENCdg.
3.	Specify the number of bytes per data point using WFMOutpre:BYT_Nr.
NOTE. MATH waveforms (and REF waveforms that came from a MATH) are always set to four bytes.

4.	Specify the portion of the waveform that you want to transfer using
DATa:STARt and DATa:STOP.
5.	Transfer waveform preamble information using WFMOutpre.
6.	Transfer waveform data from the instrument using CURVe?.
Transferring waveform data to the instrument.
1.	Specify waveform reference memory using DATa:DESTination.
2.	Set WFMInpre:NR_Pt to equal the number of data points to be sent.
3.	Specify the waveform data format using WFMInpre:ENCdg.
4.	Specify the number of bytes per data point using WFMInpre:BYT_Nr.
5.	Specify first data point in the waveform record using DATa:STARt.
6.	Transfer waveform preamble information using WFMInpre.
7.	Transfer the waveform data using CURVe.
NOTE. FastAcq and FastFrame waveforms cannot be returned to the instrument via the CURVe command
